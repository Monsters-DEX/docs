Upcoming Ecosystem Launch: Monsters x Chainlink Oracle Integration, Liquidation Plan for NFTs, Multi-Asset collateralization.

We are excited to announce the upcoming launch of our new ecosystem, featuring a strategic partnership between Monsters and Chainlink for exclusive oracle integration. This integration will enhance our platform's security, reliability, and real-time data feeds, ensuring accurate and transparent transactions for our users.

One of the key highlights of our ecosystem is the implementation of a robust liquidation plan for NFTs. Through this plan, users will have the ability to efficiently liquidate their NFT assets when needed, ensuring liquidity and minimizing potential losses. This innovative approach adds a new dimension to our platform, providing additional value and flexibility to our users.

Furthermore, our ecosystem will support multi-asset collateralization, enabling users to utilize a diverse range of digital assets as collateral for various financial activities. This feature enhances the utility and accessibility of our platform, empowering users with more opportunities to engage in decentralized finance (DeFi) and unlock the value of their assets.

Additionally, we are thrilled to announce the release of the Long Short DeFi Index (LSDFI). Serving as a benchmark for the DeFi market's performance, this index provides valuable insights and investment opportunities for our users. The LSDFI aims to capture the overall trends and movements of the DeFi sector, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic investment strategies.
