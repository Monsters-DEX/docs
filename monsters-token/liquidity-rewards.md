# ðŸ¤‘ Liquidity Rewards

### Introduction

To collectively build a stable MST-Trade trading ecosystem and incentivize user participation, the MST distribution mechanism has set up a series of incentives with a focus on liquidity providers.

In the MST distribution, 53% of MST tokens are allocated to incentivize users committed to maintaining trading stability. This measure aims to ensure that the exchange has sufficient liquidity to provide a seamless trading environment.

30% of the positive fees generated from trading activities are used to mint new MST tokens. This means that as trading volume increases, the supply of MST also increases, encouraging more users to participate and trade.

The incentives are divided into Tier 1 Liquidity Mining and Tier 2 Liquidity Mining:

### Tier 1 Liquidity Mining accounts for 30% of the total incentives

Users simply need to provide USDT as liquidity in the MST-USDT Vault to become liquidity providers on the market trading side. The fees generated from trading strategies are used to mint new MST tokens, which are then allocated to Tier 1 liquidity providers. Additionally, LPs participating in the "no loss" mining program enjoy protection mechanisms and stable investment returns.
