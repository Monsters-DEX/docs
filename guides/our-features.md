## How does it work?

Trades are USDT collateral, regardless of the trading pair. The leverage is synthetic and backed by the[ ](broken-reference)MST-USDT Vault, and the MST token.USDT is taken from the vault to pay the traders PNL (if positive) or receives USDT from trades their PnL was negative.

### Most fair

The Chainlink effectively filters out any outlier price action happening on a single exchange, whether done through manipulation purposes or simply from a lack of liquidity, allowing traders to rest at ease since they don't be liquidated because of a scam wick, for example.

It is worth noting that these are **your** trades. **We cannot open, close, or edit any aspect of your open trades** unless you have approved the smart contract to allow this by setting a stop loss or take profit, or if you are in a position which necessitates liquidation.&#x20;

Please note that there is a function available to governance to pause the opening of new trades which is used when a contract is upgraded  - but this would not close any traders open positions, **all traders still retain control** on closing their trades.

Finally, the trading engine is **fully decentralized** and users **keep custody of the funds**. We do not require any sign up or deposit to start trading.

### Exceptional user experience

Due to the high liquidity efficiency of using a single liquidity pool and MST-USDT vault for all orders executed on all pairs listed, we are able to offer the **widest trading pairs and leverages offering**.

### Competitive trading fees

The fees are distributed to the team, project fund, MST-USDT liquidity providers, MST staking, referrals, and to the network of NFT bots executing the limit orders in a decentralized manner.

### Liquidity efficiency

Since all trades use USDT liquidity layer (trading vault), we have a big advantage over other platforms who have to build new liquidity in their order books every time they list a new pair, and maintain high liquidity on each pair.

By building a big USDT vault (with trading fees incentives), every trading pair listed on our platform benefits from bigger position sizes. This means the platform only requires USDT liquidity for **ALL** pairs that can be traded on the platform.&#x20;

This is only possible because our architecture doesn't match buying/selling orders using an order book, and because the leverage of trades is "virtual". The PnL is calculated in our smart contracts and settled against the MST-USDT vault.
