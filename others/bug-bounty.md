### Rewards Based on Threat Level <a href="#rewards-based-on-threat-level" id="rewards-based-on-threat-level"></a>

Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Vulnerability Severity Classification System. This is a simplified scale, categorized by the impact of the reported vulnerabilities, differentiating between websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs.All web/app vulnerability reports must include a Proof of Concept (PoC) with an end-effect that impacts an asset within the scope, in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements will not be accepted as PoC; code is required.Rewards are primarily based on risk funds, considering PR and branding aspects at the discretion of the team. The minimum reward is $5,000.00 USD, with the maximum reward for critical smart contract vulnerabilities capped at 10% of economic loss.Payouts will be managed directly by the Monsters team, denominated in USD. However, rewards will be paid in MST and USDT, with the ratio determined by the team.By participating in this bug bounty program, you contribute to enhancing the security of the Monsters ecosystem. Make sure to consult the provided program documentation and guidelines for a comprehensive understanding of the reward structure and terms. Your efforts play a crucial role in maintaining a safe and robust platform.
